This is iOS code using SwiftUI + RealityKit + Computer Vision.

This is a demo to see if we can use SwiftUI with RealityKit and the Vision framework to:
* recognize objects in the camera's view
* create 3D text of what was recognized
* place that 3D text in the camera's view near what was recognized

Here is a code walk-through on YouTube.
