<p>Wow!
I annoyed my family for week with this book.
I kept shouting out facts or audible reactions to this book.</p>
<p>This was the first book I read by Bill Bryson, and after it I picked up two more. This is the kind of write that can make any topic interesting to read, like Michael Lewis or Malcolm Gladwell.</p>
<p>I got this from the library, then bought my own copy because I wanted to mark it up with notes.</p>
<p>I have many notes, and I will need to put them in here later.</p>
