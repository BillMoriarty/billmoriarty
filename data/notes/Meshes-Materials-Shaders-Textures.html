<blockquote>
<p>Rendering in Unity uses Meshes, Materials, Shaders and Textures. They have a close relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meshes <a href="/notes/Mesh">Mesh</a> are the main graphics primitive of Unity. They define the shape of an object.</li>
<li>Materials <a href="/notes/Material">Material</a> define how a surface should be rendered, by including references to the Textures it uses, tiling information, Color tints and more. The available options for a Material depend on which Shader the Material is using.</li>
<li>Shaders <a href="/notes/shader">Shader</a> are small scripts that contain the mathematical calculations and algorithms for calculating the Color of each pixel rendered, based on the lighting input and the Material configuration.</li>
<li>Textures <a href="/notes/Texture">Texture</a> are bitmap images. A Material can contain references to textures, so that the Material’s Shader can use the textures while calculating the surface color of a GameObject. In addition to basic Color (Albedo) of a GameObject’s surface, Textures can represent many other aspects of a Material’s surface such as its reflectivity or roughness.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A Material specifies one specific Shader to use, and the Shader used determines which options are available in the Material. A Shader specifies one or more Texture variables that it expects to use, and the Material Inspector in Unity allows you to assign your own Texture Assets to these Texture variables.</li>
<li>For most normal rendering (such as rendering characters, scenery, environments, solid and transparent GameObjects, hard and soft surfaces) the Standard Shader is usually the best choice. This is a highly customisable shader which is capable of rendering many types of surface in a highly realistic way.</li>
<li>There are other situations where a different built-in Shader, or even a custom written shader might be appropriate (for example liquids, foliage, refractive glass, particle effects, cartoony, illustrative or other artistic effects, or other special effects like night vision, heat vision or x-ray vision).</li>
</ul>
