<p>These are notes from listening to Immersive Analytics with Tim Dwyer, a podcast interview on Data Stories 2019. These are free-form and I make no guarantee of  correct grammar. </p>
<p>He started studying this field around 2001</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My take: We’re still, in 2022, kinda in the same place as described here...
imagining AR as a way to look at a physical object and seeing or hearing information</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An AR headset can talk to the output of an IoT connected machine</p>
<ul>
<li>Get that info into your headset</li>
</ul>
<p>Aim to use natural gestures</p>
<p>They simulate Augmented Reality environments in virtual reality.
The VR devices have a wider field of view.
The controllers you get with VR devices track very accurately.</p>
<p>They create screens hanging in the virtual space - they're interested in the combination of the screens.</p>
<p>That allows us to imagine the future more than working in the current limitations of the AR technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Human Computer Interaction</li>
<li>Filtering in data visualization </li>
</ul>
<p>What does a ‘slider’ look like in VR???
The way this was solved on the desktop needs to be rethought </p>
<p>Today is like the 1980's</p>
<ul>
<li>people explored a lot of kinds of computer mouse until they found what actualyl works</li>
<li>many people don't know how much university work went into that kind of research </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of challenges to solve </p>

“Maps of movements of people, or trader, overlaid on a cartographic map.”
This has been discussed in the visualization community for a long time.
In the 19th century there
More recently they were generated automatically onto 2d maps
We show flows on the globe. You have the classic problem </p>
<blockquote>
<p>side note from Bill...wow…I'm just remembering I’ve had this dream since I was a young kid - seeing a slowly spinning globe in front of you that you can zoom in and out of, and see very detailed, animated information as you move in.</p>

<p>read Yolang’s work </p>
<p>In 3D, you can map 3 dimensions to x,y,z</p>
<ul>
<li>Perspective distortion</li>
<li>Occlusion</li>
</ul>
<p>Using haptics</p>
<ul>
<li>you can "feel" holes in the data</li>
<li>or feel the data as a wall</li>
<li>the takeaway from that paper (note: find the paper)both of those haptic interactions improve your ability to see inside dense clouds of data</li>
