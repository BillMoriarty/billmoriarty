<p>For anyone else that runs into this error the solution was two-fold. </p>
<ul>
<li>You have to uncheck "Strip Engine Code" in Unity under player settings > IOS. </li>
<li>Then in Xcode, you have to find (under either Swift or Apple Clang - code generation) a setting called 'Optimization Level' and set it to none.
