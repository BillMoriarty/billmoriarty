<p>The song "Asleep in my shoes" from this album is one of my favorite's I've had the pleasure to mix. I felt 100% in sync with the lyrics and sentiment here. It felt like he was singing what was in my mind. And I love how Joe brings the countdown theme from the chorus in the second verse. </p>
<p>The climbing harmonies he picked for "One day" match the aspiration in the lyrics. </p>
<p>I'm happy with the mix, which is rare for me.</p>
