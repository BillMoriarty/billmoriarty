These are notes from listening to Immersive Analytics with Tim Dwyer, a podcast interview on Data Stories 2019. These are free-form and I make no guarantee of  correct grammar. 

He started studying this field around 2001

> My take: We’re still, in 2022, kinda in the same place as described here...
imagining AR as a way to look at a physical object and seeing or hearing information

An AR headset can talk to the output of an IoT connected machine
- Get that info into your headset


Aim to use natural gestures

They simulate Augmented Reality environments in virtual reality. 
The VR devices have a wider field of view.
The controllers you get with VR devices track very accurately.

They create screens hanging in the virtual space - they're interested in the combination of the screens.

That allows us to imagine the future more than working in the current limitations of the AR technology.

- The Human Computer Interaction
- Filtering in data visualization 

What does a ‘slider’ look like in VR???
The way this was solved on the desktop needs to be rethought 

Today is like the 1980's
- people explored a lot of kinds of computer mouse until they found what actualyl works
- many people don't know how much university work went into that kind of research 


There are a *lot* of challenges to solve 

### "Flow-maps"
Yalang Yang (check spelling )
“Maps of movements of people, or trader, overlaid on a cartographic map.”
This has been discussed in the visualization community for a long time. 
In the 19th century there
More recently they were generated automatically onto 2d maps
We show flows on the globe. You have the classic problem 

> side note from Bill...wow…I'm just remembering I’ve had this dream since I was a young kid - seeing a slowly spinning globe in front of you that you can zoom in and out of, and see very detailed, animated information as you move in.

In 3D, you can map 3 dimensions to x,y,z


- Perspective distortion
- Occlusion

Using haptics
- you can "feel" holes in the data
- or feel the data as a wall
- the takeaway from that paper (note: find the paper)both of those haptic interactions improve your ability to see inside dense clouds of data


- Windows mixed reality framework 


Immersive Analytics Toolkit

InfoVis from 2018 also presented other toolkits.

> Host: 'we have go through a time when people try crazy things!'

### collaborative data visualization 
VR: data instantiated in the world around and walk around it
