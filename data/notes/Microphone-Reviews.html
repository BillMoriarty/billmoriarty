<p>I <em>love</em> microphones. I am always reading about, and trying mics. I know more about microphones than musical instruments. </p>
<p>I'm going to see how well Dendron works for creating a page to compare mics.
Other great resources:</p>

<p>Comparing the RODE Videomic NTG to the RODE Wireless Go II's built in microphone.
Both were directly next to each other.
Connected to RODE Connect mac app over usb-c.
The RODE Videomic NTG had 20db pad engaged, and 75hz low cut (which is how I would record with it.)</p>
<p>I did no post processing except to match the levels.</p>
