<p>A pretty good sci-fi book by Ann Leckie.
Read in the late Summer of 2022.</p>
<p>2014 Hugo &#x26; Nebula award winner. So...it should be good.</p>
<p>An interesting idea that is explored through the book: AI's reside in ships, and take over multiple human bodies to act as their living embodiments. They exist simultaneously in all the bodies and are connected via...tech?</p>
<p>I did not keep track of all the characters - there were many and their names were difficult to remember.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't mentioned specifically, I think all the characters were women.</p>
