<p>"Preview Mode"</p>
<ul>
<li>A feature of Unity that is not available on Macs</li>
</ul>
<p>As I understand it, on a Windows machine, you can connect an Oculus (excuse me... Meta) Quest or Quest 2 via their cable, click Play in Unity, and preview what you are building on the VR headset in real time.</p>
<p>On Mac, you have to first compile, then deploy to the device. </p>
<p>It sounds like installing Windows on a Mac doesn't remove this extra step. </p>
<p>I'll update this note as I verify these.
I do not currently, Feb 3, 2022, have a Windows computer. Just...3 Macs. </p>
