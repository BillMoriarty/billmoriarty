<p>Place this idea in your mind: a matrix is a transformation of space. </p>
<p>Transformation &#x26; Function : different terms for the same idea.
Let's think of a linear transformation as a function in a program, which takes in a vector and returns a vector.
It helps to imagine an input vector <em>moving</em> to its output vector.
Then we can imagine each vector in the entire space moving in sync.</p>

<p>Linear Transformation</p>
<ul>
<li>all lines must remain lines</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>lines can't end up curved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>it should keep grid lines parallel and evenly spaced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the Origin must remain fixed in place</li>
</ul>
<p>A linear transformation is <em>entirely</em> determined by where it moves the basis vectors in the space.</p>
<p>We write this in a 2 x 2 matrix.
Column 1 is where i hat lands.
Column 2 is where j hat lands. </p>
<p>In 2D Space:
So, if we can describe the change to i hat and j hat, we can apply i hat &#x26; j hat's change to any vector and we'll know where that vector will land. And we can know where <em>every</em> other point will end up when the change is applied.</p>
<p>x(where i hat ended up), + y(where j hat ended up) ... gotta install latex here</p>
<p>Any other vector can be described as a linear combination of those basis vectors. </p>

<p>Every time you see a matrix, you can interpret it as a certain transformation of space. -3Blue1Brown</p>

<p>When we do want to do more than one operation to a matrix, this is a Composition</p>
<p>This can still be described using just 1 matrix.
We can combine the 2 matrices that represent our individual operations into 1 matrix. </p>
<p>If you change the order that you multiply the matrices, your points will end up in a different place.
Matrix multiplication is not commutative, but it is associative. </p>
<p>And for 3 dimensions, use k hat, for a 3x3 matrix.</p>
<p>Determinant
How much a transformation scales the are of a matrix, is called the Determinant.
Cuts the area in half? The determinant is .5
Triples the area? The determinant is 3.
Space becomes a line or one point? The determinant is 0. </p>
<p>Negative determinant?
Invert the orientation of space.
The absolute value of that determinant still tells you how the area of space has been scaled.</p>
<p>In 3D, the determinant changes the volume, instead of just the area.</p>
<p>If you have a negative determinant in 3D, some orientation has flipped.</p>
<p>Applying a transformation, A, then A inverse, gets you back to where you started.
A inverse, * A = the matrix that corresponds to the transformation that does…nothing. This is also called the “identity transformation.”
[1,0
0,1]
If there is an inverse, you can use that to solve the system.</p>
<p>But, there will be no inverse if a transformation effectively removes a dimension. If a 2D becomes a line (“rank 1”), or 3D becomes a plane(“rank 2”).
The ‘rank’ means the number of dimensions in the output transformation.
Or, the numbers of dimensions in the column space.
Column space helps us understand if a solution even exists.</p>
<p>All the vectors that land on the origin (become null) are called “null space” or “kernel.”
This helps know what the set of all possible solutions could look like.</p>
<p>Below, a 3 x 2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns), is an example of a transformation from a 2D space to a 3D space.
This says: </p>
<ul>
<li>take i hat, and move it to 4,2,5.</li>
<li>take j hat, and move it to 1,3,6
| 4   | 1   |
|-----|-----|
| 2   | 3   |
| 5   | 6   |</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternately if we are transforming from 3D to 2D, the matrix would look like:
| 2   | 7   | 8   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 4   | -3  | 9   |</p>
<ul>
<li>take i hat, and move it to 2,4.</li>
<li>take j hat, and move it to 7,-3</li>
<li>take k hat, and move it to 8,9</li>
</ul>

<p>“This computation has a really nice geometric interpretation.”
Summary: Dot product is a useful geometric tool for understanding projections, and for testing if vectors tend to point in the same direction.</p>
