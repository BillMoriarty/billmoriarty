<h1 id="normalize-data">Normalize Data<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#normalize-data"></a></h1>
<p>We often want to <em>normalize</em> our data so that the numbers are all between 0 and 1.
Why?
Because if you want to make a graph, or other cool picture, sometimes the tool you want to use doesn't accept very large or very small numbers.</p>
<p>So we need to shrink or grow our numbers to be within a range that the tool accepts.</p>
<p>This often, but not always, means changing the numbers relative to each other to be between zero and one.</p>
<p>Right not, I am making a solar system in Unity for VR.
I want the planets to orbit the sun with speeds relative to actual outer space speeds.</p>
<p>Looking on wikipedia, I find the orbital speed of the planets around the sun:</p>
<p>Then the formula for normalization says:
Whats the biggest number in your data?
What's the smallest number in your data?</p>
<p>Ok now, let's normalize each number in your data one at a time.</p>
<p>let max = the largest number in our data
let min = the smallest number in our data
let n = the number we want to normalize.</p>
<p>(n - min)  / (max - min) = our 'n' normalized</p>
<p>So repeat the above formula for every number in your data to get between 0 and 1. </p>
<p>If you want to normalize this data between some other range.
For instance, if you want to make some virtual reality planet <a href="/notes/orbit">Orbits</a> around a sun, then you would want to scale these values between 0 and 360, for the degrees in a circle.</p>
<p>The additional step is</p>
<p>let desired_min = the smallest of the number range you want the data to have
let desired_max = the largest of the number range you want the data to have</p>
<p> (n - min)  / (max - min) * (desired_max - desired_min) + desired_min = our 'n' normalized to our desired range</p>
