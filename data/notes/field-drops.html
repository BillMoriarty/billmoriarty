<p>This little ARKit augmented reality app was made to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>using RealityKit to generate shapes instead of importing pre-made assets</li>
<li>create a sound/music player that I can interact with with trigger sounds</li>
<li>using animation subscriptions to programmatically, continually animate a RealityKit object. I didn't expect to need to do this, but I wanted the objects to continually spin during sound playback, and it seems that functionality is not built in. <a href="https://github.com/BillMoriarty/field-drops/blob/main/field-drops/ArWork.swift">The animation subscription is found here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted shadows on the desk from the 3D objects, but I think I only partially achieved this effect. There is a light grey circle placed on a desk under the 3D objects, and an occlusion mask applied to the 3D objects so they appear to cause something like a shadow.</p>
<p>This app is on the  App store as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/field-drops/id1630444584">"Field Drops."</a></p>
