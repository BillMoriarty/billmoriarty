I _love_ microphones. I am always reading about, and trying mics. I know more about microphones than musical instruments. 

I'm going to see how well Dendron works for creating a page to compare mics. 
Other great resources:

## RODE Videomic NTG to the RODE Wireless Go II
Comparing the RODE Videomic NTG to the RODE Wireless Go II's built in microphone.
Both were directly next to each other. 
Connected to RODE Connect mac app over usb-c.
The RODE Videomic NTG had 20db pad engaged, and 75hz low cut (which is how I would record with it.)

I did no post processing except to match the levels.
