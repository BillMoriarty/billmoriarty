Dictionary operations

New empty dictionary
```
new_dict = {}
```

Remove key and key's values from a dictionary. Just delete the key 
```
del my_dictionary['bill']
```

---

floor division vs modulo operator
```
#floor
101 // 4 = 25

#modulo
101 % 4 = 1
```
---

append to a list vs extend a list
(extend is what I expected append to do)
```
x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5]

x.append(y)
[1,2,3, [4,5] ]

x.extend(y)
[1,2,3,4,5]
```

## List operations

Remove item from list
```
# create a list
people = ['bill', 'john', 'sara']

# remove from the list
people.remove('sara)
```
