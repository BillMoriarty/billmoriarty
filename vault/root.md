* Hello. I work as software developer & research associate focusing on augmented reality and virtual reality in the [FLARE team](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/flare).

I studied computer science and software design at Temple University.

I have made a lot of recordings as a record producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer, and sometimes a musician. You may have even heard some of them.

My partner is an artist & UX designer.

We are the parents of one kid.

I spend a lot of time volunteering with The Wisdom Seat: a group of Buddhist teachers and practitioners who host spiritual teachers, sponsor meditation retreats and offer support to people on the Buddhist path.

Recording was my first love. At age 13 I got a guitar and a 4 track recorder. I have been making recordings as long as I’ve been around music.

I will keep playing with recording until I’m dead 💀💀💀

I have written some articles for one of my favorite magazines: [TapeOp️]([https://tapeop.com/searches/194699/](https://tapeop.com/searches/194699/))
