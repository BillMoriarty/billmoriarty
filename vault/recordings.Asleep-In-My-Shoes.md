The song "Asleep in my shoes" from this album is one of my favorite's I've had the pleasure to mix. I felt 100% in sync with the lyrics and sentiment here. It felt like he was singing what was in my mind. And I love how Joe brings the countdown theme from the chorus in the second verse. 

The climbing harmonies he picked for "One day" match the aspiration in the lyrics. 

I'm happy with the mix, which is rare for me.
