Wow!
I annoyed my family for week with this book. 
I kept shouting out facts or audible reactions to this book.

This was the first book I read by Bill Bryson, and after it I picked up two more. This is the kind of write that can make any topic interesting to read, like Michael Lewis or Malcolm Gladwell.

I got this from the library, then bought my own copy because I wanted to mark it up with notes.

I have many notes, and I will need to put them in here later.
