"Preview Mode"
- A feature of Unity that is not available on Macs

As I understand it, on a Windows machine, you can connect an Oculus (excuse me... Meta) Quest or Quest 2 via their cable, click Play in Unity, and preview what you are building on the VR headset without first compiling and deploying the app.

On Mac, you have to first compile, then deploy to the device. 

It sounds like installing Windows on a Mac doesn't remove this extra step. 

I'll update this note as I verify these. 
I do not currently Feb 3, 2022 at 4:48:16 PM have a Windows computer. Just...3 Macs.
