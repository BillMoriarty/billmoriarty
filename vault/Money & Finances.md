## TL;DR

The **number 1 tool** I found to stop continually running out of money has been [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=gFqsRx-YRPm-j76D).

## Long Version

My backstory to why I am writing this...

I did not learn how to manage money until I was an adult who was continually running out of money.

I worked for many years as an artist for hire. Specifically, I was a recording engineer, mixing engineer, record producer, and theater sound designer. 

I did not like dealing with money, and I wanted to be seen as a bargain.

Why? Being a bargain was what I valued.

Why did I value that? The bands and recording engineers I looked up to bragged about not being "sellouts," and I wanted to be like them. 

And so, I earned very little money during my recording career.

My wife was working in restaurants and trying to find a way to earn a living as a potter.

Then we had a baby.

Neither of us earned enough money to support a child.

On top of that problem, the bands who wanted me to record them were only available to work at night and on on weekends.

Being away nights and weekends didn't square with the kind of parents we wanted to be.

So we both needed to significantly increase our income, and change the times of day when we worked.

More to come...
