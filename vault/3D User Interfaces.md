This [book](https://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~jjl/) was recommended to me by Blair MacIntyre. 

These notes are from the 2nd edition, published in 2017.

Chapter 1.1
> "A VR application may allow a user to place an object anywhere in 3D space, with any orientation-a task for which a 2D mouse is inadequate."

Right away this reminds me of the [Brave NUI World](https://www.amazon.com/Brave-NUI-World-Designing-Interfaces/dp/0123822319) book. 

Chapter 1.2
> "...development of 3D UIs is one of the most exciting areas of research in human-computer interaction (HCI) today.

...when is "today" in this book? 2017? 
My today is Feb 1, 2022 at 10:31:43 AM

Chapter 1.3: Terminology
> Degrees of freedom: The number of independent dimensions of the motion of a body. 

At the end of this chapter the authors arrive at this definition:
>3D interaction: ...if a user tours a model of a building on her desktop computer by choosing viewpoints from a traditional menu, no 3D interaction has taken place. On the other hand, 3D interaction does not necessarily mean that 3D input devices are used...

Good distinction between the input device and the type of interaction. I could use a 3D-capable input device to interact with a 2D environment, or a 2D input device to interact with a 3D environment.
