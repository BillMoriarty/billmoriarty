I read this after hearing about it on Rogan's podcast.

Read in the Summer of 2022.

I didn't take any notes, as there was no interesting advice to be gleaned from the book.

Looking at the cover now, the only advice would be don't go into the jungle.

Thousands of people died over centuries going on expeditions into the Amazon jungle to search for legendary cities, or to search for people who went missing after going into the amazon on expeditions to search for legendary cities.
There are many ways to die in the jungle and the book makes it seem probable that if you go into the jungle you will die.

It is very well-written and I enjoyed it. I would recommend this as a fascinating book about a completely other way of spending your life.
