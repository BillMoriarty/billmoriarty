They have a close relationship.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meshes <a href=\"/notes/Mesh\">Mesh</a> are the main graphics primitive of Unity. They define the shape of an object.</li>\n<li>Materials <a href=\"/notes/Material\">Material</a> define how a surface should be rendered, by including references to the Textures it uses, tiling information, Color tints and more. The available options for a Material depend on which Shader the Material is using.</li>\n<li>Shaders <a href=\"/notes/shader\">Shader</a> are small scripts that contain the mathematical calculations and algorithms for calculating the Color of each pixel rendered, based on the lighting input and the Material configuration.</li>\n<li>Textures <a href=\"/notes/Texture\">Texture</a> are bitmap images. A Material can contain references to textures, so that the Material‚Äôs Shader can use the textures while calculating the surface color of a GameObject. In addition to basic Color (Albedo) of a GameObject‚Äôs surface, Textures can represent many other aspects of a Material‚Äôs surface such as its reflectivity or roughness.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>A Material specifies one specific Shader to use, and the Shader used determines which options are available in the Material. A Shader specifies one or more Texture variables that it expects to use, and the Material Inspector in Unity allows you to assign your own Texture Assets to these Texture variables.</li>\n<li>For most normal rendering (such as rendering characters, scenery, environments, solid and transparent GameObjects, hard and soft surfaces) the Standard Shader is usually the best choice. This is a highly customisable shader which is capable of rendering many types of surface in a highly realistic way.</li>\n<li>There are other situations where a different built-in Shader, or even a custom written shader might be appropriate (for example liquids, foliage, refractive glass, particle effects, cartoony, illustrative or other artistic effects, or other special effects like night vision, heat vision or x-ray vision).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Home","desc":"Personal Website of Bill Moriarty","updated":1673749560079,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ffde8fd27559f8d19705063ad3e5f2c0","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["Advice-for-Artists","Apple-Augmented-Reality-Notes","Augmented-Reality-Project","Books","Computer-Vision-References","git-commands-reference","Giving-Up-A-Smartphone","Linear-Algebra","Machine-Learning","Microphone-Reviews","Money-&-Finances","Normalize-Data","Python-References","TypeScript","Unity","fakolx1uvji6122gd5tci4c","Recordings"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"Hello.
