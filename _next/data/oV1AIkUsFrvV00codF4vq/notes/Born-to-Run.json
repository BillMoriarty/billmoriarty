You start with easy, because if that's all you get, that's not so bad.\nThen work on light. Make it effortless, like you don't give a shit how\nhigh the hill is or how far you've got to go. When you've practiced\nthat so long that you forget you're practicing, you work on making it\nsmoooooth. You won't have to worry about the last one-you get\nthose three, and you'll be fast.\"\nI kept my eyes on Caballo's sandaled feet, trying to duplicate his\nodd, sort of tippy-toeing steps. I had my head down so long, I didn't\nnotice at first that we'd left the forest.\n\"Wow!' I exclaimed.\nThe sun was just rising over the Sierras. Pine smoke scented the\nair, rising from dented stovepipes in the lodge-pole shacks on the\nedge of town. In the distance, giant standing stones like Faster Island\nstatues reared from the mesa floor, with snow-dusted mountains in\nthe background. Even if I hadn't been sucking wind, I'd have been\nbreathless.\n\"I told ya,\" Micah gloated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"According to our findings, currently available sports shoes ... are too soft and thick, and should be redesigned if they are to protect humans performing sports.\"\nUntil reading this study, I'd been mystified by an experience I'd\nhad at the Running Injury Clinic. I'd run back and forth over a force plate while alternating between bare feet, a superthin shoe, and the well-cushioned Nike Pegasus. Whenever I changed shoes, the impact levels changed as well--but not the way I'd expected. My impact forces were lightest in bare feet, and heaviest in the Pegs. My running form also varied: when I changed footwear, I instinctively changed my footfall. \"You're much more of a heel striker in the\nPegasus,\" Dr. Irene Davis concluded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Bramble, meanwhile, was working a little higher up the evolu-\ntionary ladder with bigcats. He discovered that when many\nquadrupeds run, their internal organs slosh back and forth like water\nin a bathtub. Every time a cheetah's front feet hit the ground, its guts slam forward into the lungs, forcing out air. When it reaches out for\nthe next stride, its innards slide rearward, sucking air back in. Adding\nthat extra punch to their lung power, though, comes at a cost: it lim-\nits cheetahs to just one breath per stride.\nActually, Dr. Bramble was surprised to find that all running mam-\nmals are restricted to the same cycle of take-a-step, take-a-breath. In\nthe entire world, he and David could only find one exception:<br>\nYou. <br>\n\"When quadrupeds run,\nthey get stuck in a one-breath-per-\nlocomotion cycle,\" Dr. Bramble said. \"But the human runners we\ntested never went one to one. They could pick from a number of dif-\nferent ratios, and generally preferred two to one.\" The reason we're\nfree to pant to our heart's content is the same reason you need a\nshower on a summer day: we're the only mammals that shed most of\nour heat by sweating. All the pelt-covered creatures in the world cool\noff primarily by breathing, which locks their entire hear-regulating\nsystem to their lungs. But humans, with our millions of sweat glands,\nare the best air-cooled engine that evolution has ever put on the\nmarket.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Epilogue\nThere is an article in the New York Times about the death of a main character in this book.\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/sports/caballo-blancos-last-run-the-micah-true-story.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/sports/caballo-blancos-last-run-the-micah-true-story.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Christopher-McDougall-ebook/dp/B0028MBKVG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=4T9SA7EVQU3E&#x26;keywords=born+to+run&#x26;qid=1660406083&#x26;sprefix=born+to+run+%2Caps%2C73&#x26;sr=8-1\">Amazon Link</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2022-08-13-11-56-06.png\"></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Home","desc":"Personal Website of Bill Moriarty","updated":1673749560079,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ffde8fd27559f8d19705063ad3e5f2c0","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["Advice-for-Artists","Apple-Augmented-Reality-Notes","Augmented-Reality-Project","Books","Computer-Vision-References","git-commands-reference","Giving-Up-A-Smartphone","Linear-Algebra","Machine-Learning","Microphone-Reviews","Money-&-Finances","Normalize-Data","Python-References","TypeScript","Unity","fakolx1uvji6122gd5tci4c","Recordings"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"Hello.
