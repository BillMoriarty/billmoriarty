And we can know where <em>every</em> other point will end up when the change is applied.</p>\n<p>x(where i hat ended up), + y(where j hat ended up) ... gotta install latex here</p>\n<p>Any other vector can be described as a linear combination of those basis vectors. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every time you see a matrix, you can interpret it as a certain transformation of space. -3Blue1Brown</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we do want to do more than one operation to a matrix, this is a Composition</p>\n<p>This can still be described using just 1 matrix.\nWe can combine the 2 matrices that represent our individual operations into 1 matrix. </p>\n<p>If you change the order that you multiply the matrices, your points will end up in a different place.\nMatrix multiplication is not commutative, but it is associative. </p>\n<p>And for 3 dimensions, use k hat, for a 3x3 matrix.</p>\n<p>Determinant\nHow much a transformation scales the are of a matrix, is called the Determinant.\nCuts the area in half? The determinant is .5\nTriples the area? The determinant is 3.\nSpace becomes a line or one point? The determinant is 0. </p>\n<p>Negative determinant?\nInvert the orientation of space.\nThe absolute value of that determinant still tells you how the area of space has been scaled.</p>\n<p>In 3D, the determinant changes the volume, instead of just the area.</p>\n<p>If you have a negative determinant in 3D, some orientation has flipped.</p>\n<p>Applying a transformation, A, then A inverse, gets you back to where you started.\nA inverse, * A = the matrix that corresponds to the transformation that does‚Ä¶nothing. This is also called the ‚Äúidentity transformation.‚Äù\n[1,0\n0,1]\nIf there is an inverse, you can use that to solve the system.</p>\n<p>But, there will be no inverse if a transformation effectively removes a dimension. If a 2D becomes a line (‚Äúrank 1‚Äù), or 3D becomes a plane(‚Äúrank 2‚Äù).\nThe ‚Äòrank‚Äô means the number of dimensions in the output transformation.\nOr, the numbers of dimensions in the column space.\nColumn space helps us understand if a solution even exists.</p>\n<p>All the vectors that land on the origin (become null) are called ‚Äúnull space‚Äù or ‚Äúkernel.‚Äù\nThis helps know what the set of all possible solutions could look like.</p>\n<p>Below, a 3 x 2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns), is an example of a transformation from a 2D space to a 3D space.\nThis says: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>take i hat, and move it to 4,2,5.</li>\n<li>take j hat, and move it to 1,3,6\n| 4   | 1   |\n|-----|-----|\n| 2   | 3   |\n| 5   | 6   |</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternately if we are transforming from 3D to 2D, the matrix would look like:\n| 2   | 7   | 8   |\n|-----|-----|-----|\n| 4   | -3  | 9   |</p>\n<ul>\n<li>take i hat, and move it to 2,4.</li>\n<li>take j hat, and move it to 7,-3</li>\n<li>take k hat, and move it to 8,9</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-importance-of-dot-products\">The Importance Of Dot Products<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-importance-of-dot-products\"></a></h3>\n<p>[4] <em> [2]<br>\n[1][-1]<br>\n=(4 </em> 2) + (1 * -1)</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis computation has a really nice geometric interpretation.‚Äù\nSummary: Dot product is a useful geometric tool for understanding projections, and for testing if vectors tend to point in the same direction.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Home","desc":"Personal Website of Bill Moriarty","updated":1673749560079,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ffde8fd27559f8d19705063ad3e5f2c0","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["Advice-for-Artists","Apple-Augmented-Reality-Notes","Augmented-Reality-Project","Books","Computer-Vision-References","git-commands-reference","Giving-Up-A-Smartphone","Linear-Algebra","Machine-Learning","Microphone-Reviews","Money-&-Finances","Normalize-Data","Python-References","TypeScript","Unity","fakolx1uvji6122gd5tci4c","Recordings"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"Hello.
