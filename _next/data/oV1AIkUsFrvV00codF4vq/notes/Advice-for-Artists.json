And, hopefully someone else will like it, but you can't second guess your own taste for what someone else is going to like... it won't be good. We're not smart enough to know what someone else is going to like. \"Well, I don't really like it but I think this group of people will like it....\" it's a bad way to play the game of music or art. You have to do what's personal to you, take it as far as you can go, really push the boundaries, and people will resonate with it if they're supposed to resonate with it. But, you can't get there the other way. The other way is a dead end path.\nWhat makes it great is the personal, with all of its imperfections and quirkiness.\nHowever you see the world, that's different from how everyone else sees the world - that's why you're an artist. That's your purpose in sharing your work with the world.   </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rick Rubin</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Home","desc":"Personal Website of Bill Moriarty","updated":1673749560079,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ffde8fd27559f8d19705063ad3e5f2c0","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["Advice-for-Artists","Apple-Augmented-Reality-Notes","Augmented-Reality-Project","Books","Computer-Vision-References","git-commands-reference","Giving-Up-A-Smartphone","Linear-Algebra","Machine-Learning","Microphone-Reviews","Money-&-Finances","Normalize-Data","Python-References","TypeScript","Unity","fakolx1uvji6122gd5tci4c","Recordings"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"Hello.
